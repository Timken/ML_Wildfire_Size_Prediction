# ML_Wildfire_Size_Prediction
Predict the wildfire size using description of the causes, intervention conditions and other data.
Basic Machine learning techniques are used.

### Repo contents:
- Data manipulation using Pandas.
- Data preprocess functions (for easy data malipulation).
- Basic model training using scikit-learn.
- Evaluation of models to improve performance (Model cross-validation).
- Hyper parameter tuning (random search, grid search).
- Model comparison (Decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, Random Forest, XGB classifier).
